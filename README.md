# ModuleInference
Python code to reproduce the correlation-based inference of regulatory signaling and transcriptional modules from time-series data, as published in: Flower CT, Liu C, et al. [manuscript pending]

Run module_inference.py in the same directory as the phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic data (**Supplementary Table S1.xlsx** & **Supplementary Table S2.xlsx**).
